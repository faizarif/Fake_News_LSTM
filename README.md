## Fake News Detection using LSTM and Bi-LSTM
Welcome to the Fake News Detection project repository! This project focuses on utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) models for detecting fake news.
## Overview
Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, and this project aims to address this problem by leveraging deep learning techniques like LSTM and Bi-LSTM. These models are well-suited for analyzing sequential data, making them ideal for text classification tasks such as fake news detection.
## Dataset
Before running the code, ensure you have a suitable dataset for training and testing the models. You can use publicly available datasets like LIAR-PLUS, FakeNewsNet,ISOT,or any other dataset relevant to fake news detection.
## Requirements:
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
